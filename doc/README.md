DWG
----
DWG is a file format created in the 70's for the emerging CAD applications. Currently it is the native file format of AutoCAD, a proprietary CAD program developed by AutoDesk.

LibreDWG is a fork from LibDWG due to its usage of Esperanto, which we think is not the best strategy for a free software project which aims to get lots of contributors. LibreDWG is written in English. Since we forked LibDWG (May 16, 2009), its development seems to have been inactive. At the moment (September 25, 2009) our decoder is almost done. We are reaching 100% read support in our data structures parser but we still need a test suite. Among the example applications we wrote using LibreDWG is an initial SVG conversion tool. Please contact us if you can help.
